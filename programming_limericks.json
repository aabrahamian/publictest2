  "Lisp": "There once was a time bygone,\nWay back in computing’s dawn.\nThe language was Lisp,\nIts functions were crisp,\nBut its parentheses went on and on and on.",
  "C": "There once was a language named C,\nMade by Thompson and Ritchie.\nBut it didn’t take a smart aleck,\nTo screw up a malloc,\nFor everyone to segfault and flee.",
  "C++": "Then came a language after C,\nThat was supposed to set us all free.\nObjects were the fuss,\nFor this language called C++.\nBut it was just a fancier way to crash your PC.",
  "Perl": "There once was a language named Perl,\nThat Larry Wall thought would take over the world.\nBut the syntax was homely,\nAnd often write-only,\nAnd reading your code would make you hurl.",
  "Python": "Python was a language for you and for me\nIt was simple and clean, but slow we agree.\nBut that was ok,\nWe loved it anyway.\nUntil it went from version 2 to version 3.",
  "PHP": "There once was a language without any direction,\nIt lacked thought, and planning, and any affection.\nPHP was insane,\nAnd to save you from your pain,\nYou would need morphine in your SQL injection.",
  "Java": "There once was a great reception,\nWhen Java had its conception.\nFor many fell in love,\nBut none could rise above,\nWhen they encountered a null pointer exception.",
  "JavaScript": "JavaScript was made for the masses,\nIt lacked types, and modules, and classes.\nBut it became quite the giant,\nBecause it ran on server and client,\nUntil it crashed both, despite 100 test passes.",
  "Ruby": "Then came the wind to our sails,\nIn a language that every hipster hails.\nIts name was Ruby,\nIt made an expert from a newbie,\nUntil it got traffic and it fell off the rails.",
  "Go": "And when Ruby went over the hill,\nGo came in for the kill.\nIt seemed so fast,\nBut oh at long last,\nWe all got tired of err != nil."
